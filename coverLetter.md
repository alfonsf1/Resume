Dear Mr. Rall:  
  
Recently I have been researching the leading national companies in the healthcare industry. Your job ad posted on the UCI Medical Center career website caught my eye because of UCI’s vision which is powered by discovery and innovation.
   
Your advertisement notes that experience in a hospital setting and experience with EPIC would be a plus. I have had extensive experience in the University Hospital with the EPIC EMR, ranging from a Department Action Reports, inBasket, and work queues. In addition, my college experience includes courses in Computer Science that have broadened my experience and has made me more of a technical savvy individual. I am eager to apply what I have learned to your company.
My great customer service skills come from working at two well-known customer service driven companies that have allowed me to develop and grow as an individual. Working in a high volume setting has also helped me develop skills to multi-task as an individual but has also broadened my ability to tackle tasks in a team environment to meet urgent deadlines.  

With my training, suburb customer service skills, and hands-on experience, I believe I can a great asset to your company. Please feel free to contact me at 714/300-5778 if you wish to arrange an interview.  
  
Sincerely,
